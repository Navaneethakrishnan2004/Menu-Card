# Restaurant Menu Webpage

This is a simple HTML webpage presenting a restaurant menu. The menu is divided into three sections: Pizzas üçï, Burgers üçî, and Noodles üçù. The webpage provides a visually appealing and user-friendly display of various food items in each category.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The webpage is designed to be responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes, thanks to the use of the viewport meta tag.

- **Background Image:** A background image ('bgImg.png') is utilized to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage. The background image covers the entire page without repeating.

- **Stylish Heading:** The main heading "MENU CARD üçΩÔ∏è" is styled with a large font size, centered alignment, and a semi-transparent background to make it stand out.

- **Section Headings:** Each food category (Pizzas, Burgers, Noodles) is highlighted with a bold and colorful heading, making it easy for users to navigate through the menu.

- **Listed Items:** The food items in each category are listed using an unordered list, providing a clean and organized presentation. Each item is preceded by a bullet point for clarity.

- **Separator Line:** A horizontal line with a yellow color (#fff700) serves as a separator between the heading and the list of items in each category.

- **Footer Message:** A message "Don't waste food ü§û" is positioned at the bottom right corner of the webpage, encouraging users to be mindful of food consumption.

## Styling

- **Font:** The 'Arial' font is used for the text content to ensure readability.

- **Color Scheme:** The color scheme mainly consists of a dark background with yellow text (#ffe100) for contrast, creating a visually appealing and easily readable layout.
